You're absolutely right. I need to reconsider my recommendation with the actual use case in mind. Since this project serves as memory for Claude (me), SQL query capabilities wouldn't provide meaningful benefits.

Let me propose a more relevant improvement:

# Improvement Proposal: Memory Context Persistence

## Overview

Currently, the Memory MCP Server stores individual entities and relations effectively, but doesn't track conversation context over time. This limits Claude's ability to maintain awareness of the ongoing conversation flow and track the evolution of topics.

## Current Limitation

While Claude can store facts about entities (like user preferences or information), there's no built-in mechanism to track:

1. The progression of conversation topics
2. How recently specific entities were discussed
3. The relationship between conversation segments
4. Important inflection points in user interactions

## Proposed Solution

Add a new "ConversationContext" entity type with specialized temporal tracking that automatically maintains conversation history with decay functions for relevance.

### Implementation Details

1. Create a specialized entity type for conversation contexts:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ConversationContext:
    """Special entity representing conversation context."""
    id: str
    timestamp: float
    topic: str
    entities_mentioned: List[str]
    importance: float
    summary: str
```

2. Implement automatic context tracking in the KnowledgeGraphManager:

```python
async def update_conversation_context(
    self, 
    current_topic: str,
    entities_mentioned: List[str],
    summary: str,
    importance: float = 1.0
) -> None:
    """Update the conversation context with current information."""
    # Generate unique ID for this context point
    context_id = f"context-{int(time.time())}"
    
    # Create context entity
    context = ConversationContext(
        id=context_id,
        timestamp=time.time(),
        topic=current_topic,
        entities_mentioned=entities_mentioned,
        importance=importance,
        summary=summary
    )
    
    # Create entity from context
    entity = Entity(
        name=context_id,
        entityType="conversation_context",
        observations=[
            f"Topic: {current_topic}",
            f"Time: {datetime.fromtimestamp(context.timestamp).isoformat()}",
            f"Summary: {summary}",
            f"Entities: {', '.join(entities_mentioned)}",
            f"Importance: {importance}"
        ]
    )
    
    # Store entity
    await self.create_entities([entity])
    
    # Create relations to mentioned entities
    relations = []
    for entity_name in entities_mentioned:
        relations.append(
            Relation(
                from_=context_id,
                to=entity_name,
                relationType="mentions"
            )
        )
    
    await self.create_relations(relations)
```

3. Add a retrieval method with time-based decay for relevance:

```python
async def get_relevant_context(
    self, 
    current_entities: List[str], 
    lookback_hours: float = 24.0,
    max_results: int = 5
) -> List[dict]:
    """Get relevant conversation context with time-based decay.
    
    Returns contexts ordered by a relevance score that combines:
    - Recency (exponential decay based on time)
    - Entity overlap (matching entities with current context)
    - Importance (manually set importance value)
    """
    now = time.time()
    max_age = lookback_hours * 3600
    
    # Get contexts from recent history
    options = SearchOptions(
        fuzzy=True,
        semantic=True,
        max_results=20  # Get more than needed to filter
    )
    results = await self.search_nodes("conversation_context", options)
    
    # Calculate relevance scores
    contexts = []
    for entity in results.entities:
        if entity.entityType != "conversation_context":
            continue
            
        # Extract data from observations
        timestamp = None
        importance = 1.0
        entities_mentioned = []
        
        for obs in entity.observations:
            if obs.startswith("Time:"):
                time_str = obs.replace("Time:", "").strip()
                try:
                    dt = datetime.fromisoformat(time_str)
                    timestamp = dt.timestamp()
                except:
                    pass
            elif obs.startswith("Importance:"):
                try:
                    importance = float(obs.replace("Importance:", "").strip())
                except:
                    pass
            elif obs.startswith("Entities:"):
                entities_str = obs.replace("Entities:", "").strip()
                entities_mentioned = [e.strip() for e in entities_str.split(",")]
        
        if timestamp is None:
            continue
            
        # Skip if too old
        age = now - timestamp
        if age > max_age:
            continue
            
        # Calculate time decay (exponential)
        time_factor = math.exp(-age / (max_age/3))
        
        # Calculate entity overlap
        overlap = len(set(entities_mentioned) & set(current_entities))
        overlap_factor = overlap / max(1, len(entities_mentioned))
        
        # Combined relevance score
        relevance = (0.5 * time_factor) + (0.3 * overlap_factor) + (0.2 * importance)
        
        # Add to results
        contexts.append({
            "id": entity.name,
            "relevance": relevance,
            "age_hours": age / 3600,
            "entity": entity
        })
    
    # Sort by relevance and return top results
    contexts.sort(key=lambda x: x["relevance"], reverse=True)
    return contexts[:max_results]
```

## Benefits for Claude

1. **Conversational Continuity**: Claude can maintain awareness of conversation flow
2. **Topic Tracking**: Automatically track how topics evolve over time
3. **Relevance Awareness**: Understand which memories are most relevant to the current conversation
4. **Memory Prioritization**: Use importance scores to ensure critical memories persist
5. **Natural Conversation**: Reduce repetitive questions or explanations when topics recur

## Implementation Complexity

This enhancement builds on the existing entity-relation structure without requiring significant architectural changes. It adds specialized entity types and helper methods but preserves compatibility with the underlying storage system.

## Conclusion

By implementing conversation context tracking, Claude's memory capabilities would be significantly enhanced, moving beyond simple fact storage to understanding the contextual flow of conversations. This would make interactions feel more natural and continuous, especially for recurring users with ongoing discussions spanning multiple sessions.
